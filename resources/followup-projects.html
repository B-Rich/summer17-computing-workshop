<p>As time constrained, there are always things this series of lessons cannot cover and things that may not fit everyone's taste in class.
We provide a followup project opportunity so that our workshop participants can work closely with one or two menters and learn more from practice for their own needs.
All instructors of this workshop series can provide technical supports on topics that are related to the content covered in the class and extended techniques on testing, documentations and programmings
to the participants over time.
Many CQuIC senior students have also generously accepted our invitations to provide research-related mentorships and guidance for each participant to finish up a basic followup project.
In principle, the followup project are encouraged to be hosted on <a href="https://github.com/CQuIC" target="_blank">CQuIC@GitHub</a> organizational repos (either private or public),
and should fit into the research interests of both participating student and the mentor(s).
This opportunity is completely voluntary and open to CQuIC students in all levels.
There is no time limit in completing the project nor third-party evaluations.
But all projects should be programming-based and are encouraged to pass peer reviews by at least one reviewer before the codes are merged to the repo.
Anyone can be a code reviewer with or without the invitation of project participants.
If you would like to try your hands on doing a followup project, please don't hesitate to contact a mentor and ask one organizor of this workshop to set up a repo for you to take off.</p>

<p>List of senior students who have accepted to be a mentor with their experties and planned mentees (mentors and project topics don't have to be from this list, and of course, one can be self-guided):
  <ol>
    <li>Adrian Chapman: Matrix Product States with object-oriented programming in Python.</li>
    <li>Ciaran: quantum error correction (may work with Jaimie, repo may not be seen in public per the lab policy). </li>
    <li>Ezad: quantum control (may work with Anupam and Qi).</li>
    <li>Gopi: quantum chaos and some quantum simulation topics (may work with Karthik).</li>
    <li>Qi: quantum measurements, stochastic processes and <a href="https://juliaquantum.github.io/" target="_blank">JuliaQuantum</a> related projects (may work with Arizona group on their lab code base and may not in a public repo).</li>
    <li>Travis: control and data processing (may work with Nate).</li>
  </ol>
</p>

<p>Confirmed projects open for peer-reviews (feel free to add your own project in a <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/">Pull Request</a> to this repo on the gh-pages branch):
  <ol>
    <li>Ninnat (Tom): Quantum tomography with <a href="http://qinfer.org">QInfer</a> (a repo to open once the plan is discussed with mentor).</li>
  </ol>
